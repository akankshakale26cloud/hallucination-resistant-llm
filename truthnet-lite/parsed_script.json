SMART HULK Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right?29 30Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites. STEVE He's heard. SMART HULK It was worse for me.  Because I lost twice.  First Hulk lost.  Then Banner lost.  Then we all lost. NATASHA No one blamed you, Bruce. SMART HULK I did-  I feel like I'm the only one eating.  Here, try some. He holds out a pizza.  They decline.  He shrugs. SMART HULK(CONT'D) Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn't have to be that way.  That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they'd worked together, maybe they could've stopped Thanos. SCOTT LANG Okay.  But how did...this happen? SMART HULK For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure... Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together. SMART HULK(CONT'D) Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together.  And now look at me. Best of both worlds. TWO KIDS amble up to the booth. KID Mr. Hulk?  Can we get a picture? SMART HULK 100%, little lady. The kid hands a phone to Steve.  SMART HULK makes a duck face as Steve sheepishly snaps the pic, handing the phone back.30 31SMART HULK(CONT'D) (to the fan) Thanks, pal.  Hulk out! STEVE So, Bruce, about what we said- SMART HULK The time travel do-over?  I don't know, that's kind of outside my field of expertise... Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them. NATASHA You pulled this off.  I remember a time that was impossible, too. He considers, then finally relents, pulling out his phone. SMART HULK I'm supposed to be on Oprah next week, but I guess I could move things around.",
